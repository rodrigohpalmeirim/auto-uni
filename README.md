# auto-uni
I'll put all my university related automation scripts here.

Instructions:
Copy "config.example.py" to "config.py" and add a link to your .ics calendar.
Do `python openlink.py -u` to update the calendar, from now on you can run it without the -u flag, until you want to update the calendar again.
